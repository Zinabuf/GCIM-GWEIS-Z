Description: Provides tools for genome-wide-by-environment interaction analyses
    using the Genetic Causality Inference Model (GCIM).
    The package supports GWAS and GWEIS using PLINK, construction
    and scaling of polygenic risk scores, preparation of GCIM-formatted
    interaction summary statistics, linkage disequilibrium score
    regression (LDSC) for confounding assessment, and LDSC
    intercept-based Z-score correction for interaction effects.
    These utilities enable standardized pipelines for GCIM-GWEIS-Z
    analyses in large-scale genetic studies.
