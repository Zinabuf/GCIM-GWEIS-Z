# GCIM-GWEIS-Z
The Genetic Causality Inference Model (GCIM) for genome-wide environment interaction studies (GWEIS), incorporating adjusted Z-scores (Z), is a statistical framework designed to infer the causal direction of SNP–environment interactions and to correct inflation in GxE effects arising from heteroscedasticity.
