The Genetic Causality Inference Model (GCIM) for genome-wide-by-environment interaction studies (GWEIS), incorporating adjusted Z-scores (Z), is a statistical framework designed to infer the causal direction of SNP-by-environment interactions and to correct inflation in GxE effects arising from heteroscedasticity.
