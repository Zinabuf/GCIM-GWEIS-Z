\title{Perform GWAS for a quantitative covariate (discovery sample)}
\usage{
q_gwas(plink_path, dis_snp, qp_dis_cov)
}
\arguments{
\item{plink_path}{Character. Path to the PLINK (v2.0) executable.}

\item{dis_snp}{Character. Prefix of PLINK binary files
(.bed/.bim/.fam) for the discovery dataset.}

\item{qp_dis_cov}{Character. File path to phenotype and covariate file.
Columns must be:
\itemize{
\item 1: FID
\item 2: IID
\item 3: Quantitative phenotype
\item 4-K: Covariates
}}
}
\value{
A list containing file paths to GWAS outputs stored in a
temporary directory:
\describe{
\item{glm_file}{Path to PLINK .glm.linear file}
\item{additive_effects}{Path to extracted additive SNP effects}
\item{tmp_dir}{Temporary directory used by the function}
\item{log_file}{Path to PLINK log file}
\item{n_snps}{Number of additive SNP effects extracted}
}
}
\description{
This function runs a PLINK GWAS for a quantitative phenotype and
extracts additive SNP effects for downstream GCIM-GWEIS-Z models.
All intermediate and output files are written to a temporary directory.
}
\details{
This function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Creates a temporary directory for all outputs
\item Runs PLINK GWAS with covariate adjustment
\item Extracts additive SNP effects (TEST equals ADD)
\item Saves results to temporary files for pipeline continuity
}
}
